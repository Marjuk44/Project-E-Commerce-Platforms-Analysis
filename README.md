# Project-Online-Shopping-Store-Analysis
Final Project for the Data Analytics Full Time (Jul'24) Bootcamp at Ironhack, Lisbon. 
This project is still on going. Currently uploading here to get feedback from our teachers. In my opinion, the improve we can make here are:

- Create a .py file where all the webscrapping code stores
- in a single ipynb file with the help of py file loading all the online stores product data
- after loading the data cleaning and preparing for the EDA
- anoher ipynb file just to to the EDA

This is my idea to improve intially. 

Nevertheless, I can still try to figure out how can I extract n_sold_unit data through webscrapping. Which was done by manually. At a point to save time before the project, that was the only option. 

Another painfull try could be fighting with temu captcha to extract data from the website.
