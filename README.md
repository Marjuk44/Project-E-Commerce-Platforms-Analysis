# Project-Online-Shopping-Store-Analysis
Final Project for the Data Analytics Full Time (Jul'24) Bootcamp at Ironhack, Lisbon.

This project focuses on analyzing product prices and popularity across three major e-commerce platforms: Amazon.de, AliExpress, and Temu. Data was collected through web scraping for Amazon.de and AliExpress, and supplemented with a Kaggle dataset for Temu. The analysis targets the top 100 best-selling products from the five most popular online shopping categories. Results show significant differences in average prices across the platforms, as well as a strong correlation between product reviews and sales volumes. A customer survey conducted in Europe and North America further revealed that while Amazon maintains a dominant position, Temu is gaining traction in certain categories. The next phase of the project will involve developing a service or application that allows sellers to benchmark their products against competitors, and helps buyers easily compare product prices and popularity.


## Initial improvement
- Create a .py file where all the webscrapping code stores
- A single ipynb file to load all the online stores product data by using the .py file
- After loading the data cleaning and preparing for the EDA
- Anoher ipynb file just to to the EDA

## Future improvement
- Webscrap amazon to extract n_sold_unit which conducted manually to save time before final submission.
- Keep fighting with Temu captcha to extract data from this website.
